# debdevbase
Little kickstart script for customizing a minimal clean Debian Bookworm installation for dev-usage in a virtual machine.

The setup is as follows:
 - LightDM
 - i3 with gaps
 - Polybar
 - Rofi
 - Alakritty
 - Firefox ESR
 - A little bit of theming...

## Usage
The repo should be cloned into the home directory and the debdevbase.sh should be executed with 'sudo'.
